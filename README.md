Create a file named `creds.py`  Ã¬n the same directory as main.py 

Add two variables in it : 

````python
user = 'mymail@mail.fr'
password = '<my_password>'

Check if the path of firefox in `main.py` is the same as yours.

You can go !

```
python main.py

You can go to sleep now, or play some games....
